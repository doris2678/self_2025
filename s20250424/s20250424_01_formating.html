        Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
        Don't let them in, don't let them see
        Be the good girl you always have to be
        Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
        Well, now they know
        Let it go, let it go
        Can't hold it back anymore
        Let it go, let it go
        Turn away and slam the door
        I don't care what they're going to say
        Let the storm rage on
        The cold never bothered me anyway
