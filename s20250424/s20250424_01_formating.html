    <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Let it go </h3>    
    <p>
        <b>This</b>snow glows white on the mountain tonight
        Not a footprint to be seen
        A kingdom of isolation
        And it looks like I'm the queen
        The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
        Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
        Don't let them in, don't let them see
        Be the good girl you always have to be
        Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
        Well, now they know
        Let it go, let it go
        Can't hold it back anymore
        Let it go, let it go
        Turn away and slam the door
        I don't care what they're going to say
        Let the storm rage on
        The cold never bothered me anyway        
    </p>
